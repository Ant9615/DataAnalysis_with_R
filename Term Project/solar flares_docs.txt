1. TItle: Solar Flare database

2. Source Information
   -- Donor: Gary Bradshaw <gbradshaw@clipr.colorado.EDU>
   -- Date: 3/89

3. Past Usage:
   -- Gary Bradshaw: (Class Attributes were collapsed to 0 and >0)
   -- See the past-usage file for a note written by Gary Bradshaw

4. Relevant Information:
   -- The database contains 3 potential classes, one for the number of times a
      certain type of solar flare occured in a 24 hour period.
   -- Each instance represents captured features for 1 active region on the 
      sun.
   -- The data are divided into two sections. The second section (flare.data2)
      has had much more error correction applied to the it, and has 
      consequently been treated as more reliable.

5. Number of Instances:  flare.data1: 323, flare.data2: 1066

6. Number of attributes:  13 (includes 3 class attributes)

7. Attribute Information:
   1. Code for class (modified Zurich class)  (A,B,C,D,E,F,H)
   2. Code for largest spot size              (X,R,S,A,H,K)
   3. Code for spot distribution              (X,O,I,C)
   4. Activity                                (1 = reduced, 2 = unchanged)
   5. Evolution                               (1 = decay, 2 = no growth, 3 = growth)
   6. Previous 24 hour flare activity code    (1 = nothing as big as an M1, 2 = one M1, 
				3 = more activity than one M1)
   7. Historically-complex                    (1 = Yes, 2 = No)
   8. Did region become historically complex  (1 = yes, 2 = no) 
      on this pass across the sun's disk
   9. Area                                    (1 = small, 2 = large)
  10. Area of the largest spot                (1 = <=5, 2 = >5)
