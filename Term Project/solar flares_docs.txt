1. TItle: Solar Flare database

2. Source Information
   -- Donor: Gary Bradshaw <gbradshaw@clipr.colorado.EDU>
   -- Date: 3/89

3. Past Usage:
   -- Gary Bradshaw: (Class Attributes were collapsed to 0 and >0)
   -- See the past-usage file for a note written by Gary Bradshaw

4. Relevant Information:
   -- The database contains 3 potential classes, one for the number of times a
      certain type of solar flare occured in a 24 hour period.
   -- Each instance represents captured features for 1 active region on the 
      sun.
   -- The data are divided into two sections. The second section (flare.data2)
      has had much more error correction applied to the it, and has 
      consequently been treated as more reliable.

5. Number of Instances:  flare.data1: 323, flare.data2: 1066

6. Number of attributes:  13 (includes 3 class attributes)

7. Attribute Information:
Class: Code for class (modified Zurich class), A,B,C,D,E,F,H로 구성
LSP: Code for largest spot size, X,R,S,A,H,K로 구성
SD: Code for spot distribution, X,O,I,C로 구성
Activity: 1 = reduced, 2 = unchanged
Evoluation: 1 = decay, 2 = no growth, 3 = growth
Activity24: Previous 24 hour flare activity code (1 = nothing as big as an M1, 2 = one M1, 3 = more activity than one M1)
HC: Historically-complex (1 = Yes, 2 = No)
RHC: Did region become historically complex  (1 = yes, 2 = no) on this pass across the sun's disk
Area: 1 = small, 2 = large
ALS: Area of the largest spot (1 = <=5, 2 = >5)
아래는 추가변수들이다.
C_class: C-class flares production by this region in the following 24 hours (common flares); Number
M_class: M-class flares production by this region in the following 24 hours (moderate flares); Number
X_class: X-class flares production by this region in the following 24 hours (severe flares); Number





ALS가 2 이상이 아니면 LSP가 X로 분류되고, 2이상이면 SD가 C,I 아니면 S로 C, I면 SD가 I면 A, 이외는 K로 분류되는 것을 볼 수 있다. 다음으로 테스트 데이터를 이용해서 예측률, 교차검증, 모델 정보를 알아보자.
